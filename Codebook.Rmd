The run_analysis.R script automates the file download and data pre-processing, followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project guidelines.

1. Set the working directory 
Sets the working directory, where the data will be downloaded and script is saved.

2. Download the dataset

Dataset downloaded from the link and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset in the set working directory.

3. Preparing the data: Assign each data to variables

features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its labels

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains a column of numerical identifiers that uniquely identifies a subject/participant

x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded observations from test dataset

y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains list of activity labels from test dataset

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains a column of numerical identifiers that uniquely identifies a subject/participant

x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded observations from train dataset

y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains list of activity labels from train dataset

Creating the tidy dataset

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set

X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function

Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function.

Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, labels and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement.

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Entire numbers in label column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable.

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

labels column in TidyData renamed into activities
All Acc in the column names replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in the column names replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in the column names replaced by Body
All Mag in the column names replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in the columns name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in the columns name replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by summarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after grouping by activity and subject

Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
